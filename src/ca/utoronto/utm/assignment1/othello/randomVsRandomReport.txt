RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy? 

After running OthelloControllerRandomVSRandom several times, there has been a consistent
trend of the second player having a higher winrate than the first player when choosing
random moves.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

I think having several way to explain a harder, unintuitive concept to understand such as 
statistics through writing intuitive code is helpful, especially now that most students in 
CSC207 are also in STA256. I found the Direct Simulation and Shuffling methods specifically 
appealing to me, as I find computational approaches more intuitive than statistical rules.
I also liked the way the speaker emphasized the importance of keeping the question to be solved
in mind for "hacking" statistics. I think this is important in all fields, not just statistics.

4) H0 is that the discrepancy between the winrates of the first or second player is due to 
sampling/experimental errors, it should be an equal probability of winning for each player.

5) Ha is that the discrepancy between the winrates of the first or second player is significant,
the second player has an advantage to winning over the first player.

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
Please see the RandomVSRandomShuffling class and its main method output. This is one of the possible outputs:

Trial 0
Probability P1 wins=0.4603
Probability P2 wins=0.4986

Trial 1
Probability P1 wins=0.4464
Probability P2 wins=0.5097

Trial 2
Probability P1 wins=0.453
Probability P2 wins=0.502

Trial 3
Probability P1 wins=0.4569
Probability P2 wins=0.503

Trial 4
Probability P1 wins=0.4587
Probability P2 wins=0.4996

Trial 5
Probability P1 wins=0.4585
Probability P2 wins=0.5021

Mean before shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.4556333
Mean P2 wins=0.5025
Difference in means=0.046866685

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.47058332
Mean P2 wins=0.48755
Difference in means=0.01696667

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.48885
Mean P2 wins=0.46928334
Difference in means=-0.019566655

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.48513332
Mean P2 wins=0.47300002
Difference in means=-0.0121333

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.46928334
Mean P2 wins=0.48885
Difference in means=0.019566655

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.47058332
Mean P2 wins=0.48755
Difference in means=0.01696667

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.488
Mean P2 wins=0.4701333
Difference in means=-0.0178667

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.46971667
Mean P2 wins=0.48841664
Difference in means=0.018699974

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.4893
Mean P2 wins=0.46883333
Difference in means=-0.020466685

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.48843333
Mean P2 wins=0.46969998
Difference in means=-0.018733352

Mean after shuffling:
Mean P1 wins=0.47386667
Mean P2 wins=0.48426667
Difference in means=0.010399997

We can then plot a graph with the data to see where our measured data lies. Even without doing so,
we can see that our measured data (difference between means before shuffling) lies far beyond 
the other differences between means after shuffling. We can repeat these trials several times, 
but it is quite evident that the trials argue against the null hypothesis.
